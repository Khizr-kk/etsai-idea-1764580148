## Idea Summary
AI-powered clinical decision support for outpatient care to reduce diagnostic errors and unnecessary testing.

## Problem Statement
Outpatient care suffers from diagnostic errors and unnecessary testing, leading to suboptimal patient outcomes, increased costs, and clinician burnout.

## Target Persona
Outpatient Clinician (GP, Family Doctor)

## MVP Features
- AI-powered diagnostic suggestion engine (ranked list of potential diagnoses with probabilities)
- AI-driven test recommendation system (suggests necessary tests, flags potentially unnecessary ones)
- Secure EHR integration for patient data ingestion (structured data initially)
- Clinician dashboard for reviewing AI suggestions and associated evidence/rationale
- Robust data security and HIPAA compliance features
- User authentication and authorization

## Tech Stack
Cloud-native (AWS/Azure/GCP) for scalability and managed services. Python for AI/ML (TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-learn). Backend APIs with FastAPI/Node.js. Frontend with React/Angular/Vue. PostgreSQL/MongoDB for data storage. Docker/Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration. Emphasis on HIPAA-compliant services and robust encryption.
